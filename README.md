# Topology Distillation for Recommender System
This repository provides the source code of "Topology Distillation for Recommender System" accepted in KDD2021 as a research paper.

### 1. Overview
We develop a general topology distillation approach for RS, which guides the learning of the student by the topological structure built upon the relational knowledge in the teacher representation space.
Concretely, we propose two topology distillation methods: 

  <ol type="a">
  <li><b>Full Topology Distillation (FTD)</b>. 
      FTD transfers the full topology, and it is used in the scenario where the student has enough capacity to learn all the teacherâ€™s knowledge.</li>
  <li><b>Hierarchical Topology Distillation (HTD)</b>. HTD transfers the decomposed topology hierarchically, and it is adopted in the classical KD scenario where the student has a very limited capacity compared to the teacher.</li>
  </ol>


### 2. Main Results

- When the capacity of the student model is highly limited, the student model learns best with HTD.

- As the capacity gap between the teacher model and student model decreases, the student model takes more benefits from FTD.
